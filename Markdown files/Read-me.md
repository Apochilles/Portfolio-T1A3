##  Description of my portfolio website:
My portfolio website is an online hub that shows off my personality and professional achievements. 
  
## Purpose
My portfolio website was created to give me a strong internet presence as a developer. 
 
In this age of social media it is incredibly important to ensure you have online visibility. My website works as a hub to bring all my content together in one, easy to navigate location. 

 ## Functionality / features
 My website has clean and simple functionality and features.
 
My index page is built using flex and grid and all my other pages use various flex boxes to achieve responsiveness and positioning. 
 
My website has 5 pages. An index with site navigation, an about me summary page with resume, a contact links page with an email link, a blog and a portfolio page. 
 
I have several reused components. A social media navbar, a site navigation footer, a card that stores my and sizes my blog and portfolio posts and reused containers with different flex properties.
